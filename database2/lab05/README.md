4.	Use SQL Server Business Intelligence Development Studio to create a new Integration Services project named Bicycles_ETL.sln. In this project, you will create a new Package named Create_DW.dtsx. In this package, you will create the multi dimension database (data warehouse) and the corresponding tables. Specifically, in this package, you have a “control flow” in which you can add different tasks to this control flow. These task can be organized sequentially or parallel, as shown in the following figure. In fact, you have to create a “SQL query task” for creating the database or for creating each table. And for each task, you could put your Transact-SQL code in the “SQL-query” field corresponding to the task you want.
